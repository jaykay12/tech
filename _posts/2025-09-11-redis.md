Redis (**RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**erver) is an open source, in-memory, NoSQL key/value store that is used primarily as an application cache or quick-response database.

`Redis stores data in memory, rather than on a disk or SSD, which helps deliver unparalleled speed, reliability, and performance`

# Introduction

When an application relies on external data sources, the latency and throughput of those external sources can create a performance bottleneck, especially as the application scales. One way to improve performance in these cases is to store and manipulate data in-memory, physically closer to the application. **Redis** is built for this task.

`Fast, open source in-memory data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.`

Developed in 2009 as Open Source Project & written in ANSI C.

In 2024 Redis Inc. was formed, which used to distribute Redis under an open source license. To maintain an open source alternative, several core Redis community members launched Valkey, starting with the last open source version of Redis.

As a DBMS, Redis offers both an in-memory database and a key-value store.
- **In-memory database**: Redis stores all data directly in the memory. This results in very fast access times, even for large amounts of unstructured data.
- **Key-value store**: Impressive with their high performance and easy scalability due to their simple structure. A key is created for each entry which can then be used to retrieve the information.

`Most standard application for Redis is a cache`

# Components of Redis

![redis-components](../assets/images/REDIS-4.png)

## Redis Sentinel
- stand-alone distributed system that helps developers calibrate their instances to be highly available for clients.
- Sentinel uses a series of monitoring processes, notifications, and automatic failovers to inform users when there is something wrong with master and slave instances, while automatically reconfiguring new connections for applications when necessary.

## Redis Cluster
- distributed implementation of Redis that can automatically splits datasets among multiple nodes.
- With this, Redis can be horizontally scaled massively ensuring high availability and performance.

## Redis Pub/Sub
- users can design high-performance chat and messaging services across all their applications and services.
- This includes the ability to use list data structures to run atomic operations and blocking capabilities.

## Redis persistence
- Redis uses persistent disk storage designed to survive process outages and network bottlenecks.
- Redis can persist datasets by taking regular snapshots of data and appending them with changes as they become available.
- In the event of server failure, this will ensure database durability and integrity.

# Usecases for Redis

Redis excels in various applications, including:

- **Caching**: Supports multiple eviction policies, key expiration, and hash-field expiration.
- **Distributed Session Store**: Offers flexible session data modeling.
- **Data Structure Server**: Provides low-level data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets, JSON, etc.) with high-level semantics (counters, queues, leaderboards, rate limiters) and supports transactions & scripting.
- **NoSQL Data Store**: Key-value, document, and time series data storage.
- **Search and Query Engine**: Indexing for hash/JSON documents, supporting vector search, full-text search, geospatial queries, ranking, and aggregations via Redis Query Engine.
- **Event Store & Message Broker**: Implements queues (lists), priority queues (sorted sets), event deduplication (sets), streams, and pub/sub with probabilistic stream processing capabilities.
- **Vector Store for GenAI**: Integrates with AI applications (e.g. LangGraph, mem0) for short-term memory, long-term memory, LLM response caching (semantic caching), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Powers personalization, recommendations, fraud detection, and risk assessment.

## Why Choose Redis

Popular choice for developers worldwide due to its combination of speed, flexibility, and rich feature set.
- Performance
- Flexibility
- Extensibility
- Simplicity
- Ubiquity
- Versatility


Redis stands apart from ‘traditional’ NoSQL data stores as an auxiliary component designed specifically to improve application performance.
Few differentiating capabilities:
- Redis cache sessions
- Redis queues
- Redis data types
- Redis client handling

# Usage

## Setting up Redis

    ```
    curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install redis
    ```
