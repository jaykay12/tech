# Java Memory Management

It refers to how the JVM allocates, manages, and releases memory during the execution of Java applications. JVM uses GC to reclaim memory by removing unused objects, eliminating the need for manual memory management, thus relieving developers work.

Efficient memory management is very critical to building reliable, high-performance Java applications. JVM handles memory allocation and garbage collection automatically, but deeper understanding of how the memory is structured and managed under the hood is essential for diagnosing issues, tuning performance, and writing optimized code.
