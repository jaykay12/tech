SOLID is an acronym for 5 design principles that help software developers create object-oriented software that is maintainable, scalable, and flexible: 
- Single responsibility principle: A class should have only one reason to change. 
- Open-closed principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. (Using Interfaces)
- Liskov substitution principle: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes. 
- Interface segregation principle: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. 
- Dependency inversion principle: Depend upon abstractions, not concretes. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions. (Allows for decoupling).


Robert C. Martin introduced SOLID principles in the early 2000s.
